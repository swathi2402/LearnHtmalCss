            BridgeLabz Solutions has introduced an Income Sharing Agreement (ISA) model which provides an opportunity for the students to pursue 
            training under the BridgeLabz CodinClub and pay when they score a job. The revolutionary model prevents financial constraints from 
            hampering the skill development of learners, structuring the fee payment after gaining employment.
